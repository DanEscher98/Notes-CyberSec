## Routers
- *IOSv* is a virtualized router platform that runs a traditional Cisco IOS
  (Internetwork Operating System). Relevant for `CCNA`.
- *IOU L3* (IOS on UNIX - Layer 3) is a virtualized Layer 3 router platform.
- *IOS XRV* is a virtualized router platform that runs Cisco's IOS XR operating
  system. It is designed for use in service provider environments and supports
  advanced routing protocols. Relevant for `CCNP Service Provider`.

## Switches
- *IOSv L2* is a virtualized Layer 2 switch platform running Cisco's classic
  IOS software. Includes Layer 2 features as VLANs, STP (Spanning Tree
  Protocol), HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol), and more. Relevant for `CCNA`.
- *IOU L2* (IOS on UNIX - Layer 2) is a virtualized Layer 2 switch platform.

## Others
- *ASAv* (Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance) is a virtualized security
  appliance. It is used for simulating firewall and VPN configurations in a
  virtual environment. Relevant for `CCNP Security`.
- *ISE* (Identity Services Engine) is a security policy management platform
  that enforces security and access policies in a network. Relevant for `CCNP
  Security`.

## NOTES
- The "9000" in the name of certain Cisco virtual devices, such as IOS XRV 9000
  and NX-OSv 9000, typically denotes their association with the Cisco Nexus
  9000 Series of switches or routers. These devices are built to provide
  high-performance networking, scalability, and programmability in data
  centers.
